# Cyber-Rational Design

Cyber-rationalism combines the cold precision of technology with human-centric usability. It's not just about neon lights; it's about structure.

## Core Pillars

- **Grid Systems**: Everything must align.
- **Typography**: Mono fonts for data, Sans for humans.
- **Glassmorphism**: Layers of information.

```css
.card {
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

This design language speaks to the engineer in all of us.
