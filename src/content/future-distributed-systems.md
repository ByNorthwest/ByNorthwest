# The Future of Distributed Systems

Distributed systems are fast becoming the backbone of modern internet infrastructure. From microservices to serverless, the paradigm has shifted significantly.

## Key Trends

1. **Edge Computing**: Moving computation closer to the data.
2. **Serverless 2.0**: State management in serverless functions.
3. **Rust in Infrastructure**: Performance and safety combined.

> The network is reliable. - Fallacy #1 of Distributed Computing

We need to rethink how we handle state in a distributed world.
